# README

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with `[create-next-app](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app)`.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev# oryarn dev# orpnpm dev# orbun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) with your browser to see the result.

## Extra Works

1. Added Search function for easier data search if the data is massive
2. Added Input field validations to prevent user for inputing incorrect field that might mess up the database after updating the data

## Components

1. Input: To handle validation with itâ€™s own state
2. Modal: To handle dynamic data state
3. Search: To filter mass data
4. Table: The odd and even row has different color for easier readability
5. ToggleSwitch: Follow standard switch color to prevent confusion from user
6. Spinner: To have a feedback to user that the application is running and loading

## Future Improvement

1. The toggle button is not working correctly
2. Add pagination on the table
